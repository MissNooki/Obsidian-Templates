Obsidian Templates I created and want to share

# IMPORTANT! 
In order to use the [Weekly Compact.md](https://github.com/MissNooki/Obsidian-Templates/blob/main/Weekly%20Compact.md) properly in Obsidian, you need the [Modular CSS Layout for Obsidian](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout) and the Templater Community Plugin, which you can download directly in Obsidian.
